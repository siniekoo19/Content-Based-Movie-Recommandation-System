# Content Based Movie Recommandation System

This project aims to recommend movies based on the idea that users will like items with similar features to those they have liked before. We used cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between the movies. We utilized the Streamlit library in Python to implement the web application..

## Project Structure
- **Data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing the classification model.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts designed for preprocessing data and making predictions within the WebApp for handling new data. 
- **Models:** Saved trained models for future use or deployment.
